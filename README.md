# A* & Dijkstra Pathfinding Visualizer
## What does it do and what does it use?
- Well as you can expect, it visualizes both the A* (Still in development) and Dijkstra algorithm for pathfinding. These algorithms are generally only used for game development but are fascinating visualizations.
- It must be noted that there are issues running the A* algorithm but Dijkstra works perfectly, most likely a bug that needs to be fixed
- This uses Java Swing and Java AWT for UI
## Future plans (if I feel like it):
- Add a fix to the A* bug 
- Rather than create both A* and Dijkstra, separate them into 2, separate visualizers to put on GitHub with a more simplistic approach and ease to use rather than a complex buggy mess as version 1 of this visualizer
